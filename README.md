# merge-pdf-files using PyPDF2
This Python script utilizes the PyPDF2 library to merge multiple PDF files into a single PDF file. This can be useful when you have several PDF documents that you want to combine into one cohesive file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyPDF2 library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/parin-parikh/merge-pdf-files.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd merge-pdf-files
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install PyPDF2
   ```

## Usage

1. Place the PDF files you want to merge in the same directory as the script.

2. Open a terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the names of the PDF files you want to merge.

4. The merged PDF file will be created in the same directory as the script with the name "merged_output.pdf."

## Example

Suppose you have three PDF files: "document1.pdf," "document2.pdf," and "document3.pdf." Run the script, enter the file names when prompted, and the merged PDF file will be created as "merged_output.pdf."
